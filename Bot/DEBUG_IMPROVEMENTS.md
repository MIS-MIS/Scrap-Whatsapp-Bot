## 📋 CURRENT STATUS

### What's Working:
- ✅ Bot initialization and logging
- ✅ QR code generation
- ✅ Event handler registration
- ✅ Error detection and logging
- ✅ Automatic restart mechanisms
- ✅ Enhanced menu system

### What Needs Testing:
- 🔄 QR code scanning and authentication
- 🔄 Message sending functionality
- 🔄 Schedule execution
- 🔄 Contact loading and management

## 🔧 DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS

### To Debug Issues:
1. **Check Log.txt** - All activity is logged with timestamps
2. **Look for error patterns** - Protocol errors, Target closed, etc.
3. **Monitor restart attempts** - Bot will auto-restart up to 3 times
4. **QR Code Scanning** - Must be done within 90 seconds

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue: "Target closed" / "Protocol error"**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Auto-restart mechanism implemented
- ✅ **Fixed**: Better error detection and handling

**Issue: "Bot gets stuck after authentication"**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Proper async/await for contact loading
- ✅ **Fixed**: Sequential initialization process

**Issue: "QR code timeout"**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Extended timeout to 90 seconds
- ✅ **Fixed**: Clear timing instructions

**Issue: "No debugging information"**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Comprehensive logging to Log.txt
- ✅ **Fixed**: Error tracking and reporting

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test Authentication**: Scan QR code when it appears
2. **Verify Message Sending**: Test a small campaign
3. **Check Scheduling**: Create and test schedules
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch Log.txt for any issues

## 📊 LOG ANALYSIS

### Key Log Messages to Watch:
- `📱 QR Code generated` - Authentication required
- `🔐 WhatsApp authenticated successfully` - Auth complete
